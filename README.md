Prediction of the breed of a dog using Deep Learning(Transfer Learning)

Project om Unstrutctured data.
In this project I have tried to predict the breed of a given picture of a dog using transfer learning.
The data was downloaded from a kaggle competition.
The model was trained on 10000+ images and so was tested upon 10000+ images.
Finally after making the model we also tried the model on our custom data.
